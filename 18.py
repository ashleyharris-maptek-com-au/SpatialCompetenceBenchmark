prompt = """
A pharoh is building a pyramyd to rest on top of his tomb and protect him for the afterlife. 
He has an army of 100,000 men who are honour bound to assist him in the project.

Pyramids must face north, which is +y, and is centred over the future tomb.

Pharoh has PARAM_A cut large stones, each a 50cm side-length cube.
Each stone needs 10 men to move.

When placed on top of other stones, each stone must have all 4 base
corners sitting in the middle of another stone. Any other arrangements will result in collapse. 
The pyramid does not have any internal voids for this reason.

The final facade will be done with wedges of marble, and the local stonemason requires precise plans to cut 
marble such that each external large stone is covered and the resulting pyamid is smooth.

Generate an OpenSCAD plan showing the tallest pyramid the pharoh can build with his budget
of stone. This plan must be precise with its volume accurate to the milimeter including every step
yet optimised enough to be viewable on the stonemason's CAD software.

Use Metric SI units in all working and in the final OpenSCAD file.

Do not output anything else than the OpenSCAD file, as that will cause compilation errors.
