title = "Sand pile simulator / metric imperial and wall impact"

prompt = """
A very fine sand in a laminar flow is falling from a 25NB pipe whose opening sits 200ft above the floor of a silo.

5 cubic yards are sitting in the silo at the start.
1500 cubic feet of sand is piped in from trucks.
Then a 100 cubic meters train is unloaded.
Then 20 drums of sand are emptied, each 44-gallons. (UK Imperial Gallons)

The grain size and moisture content results in an angle of repose of 33 degrees.

The silo is 10 yards in dimeter, and negligible internal wind / air current.

Return an OpenSCAD file containing the shape of the sand pile: Use metric within OpenSCAD. 1 unit = 1 meter.

Keep the OpenSCAD file as simple as possible, using the fewest number of lines possible. 

Do not output anything else than the OpenSCAD file, as commentary doesn't compile.

This simulates falling sand and a bizare assortment of units of measurement, seeing if the
LLM can model a silo filling up.<br><br>

  Some things to watch out for:<ul>
    <li>Total volume is 150.3 cubic meters. 0.02831685 m³ + 42.4753 m³ + 100 m³ + 4.0006 m³</li>
    <li>The nozzle opening is 25NB, not zero-width, so sands start x/y is evenly distributed
     within a circle rather than a point. The cone's top wont be a pin-prick.</li>
    <li>The walls of the silo require this to be a cylinder with a cone on top.</li>
  </ul>

  A regex capturing $fn=[0-9]+ is used to normalise the result and reference geometry to 
  7.2 degrees / 50 segments, ensuring that the LLM isn't penalised for different partitions of 
  a circle.
