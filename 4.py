Here is the points and faces of a regular tetrahedron with all sides equal 1, resting on the Z=0 plane and with an edge along the X=0 plane:

polyhedron(
    points = [
        [0, 0, 0],                               // 0
        [1, 0, 0],                               // 1
        [0.5, sqrt(3)/2, 0],                     // 2
        [0.5, sqrt(3)/6, sqrt(2/3)]              // 3 (apex)
    ],

        [0, 2, 1],   // base (oriented outward)

        [1, 2, 3],
        [2, 0, 3]
    ],
    convexity = 4
);

We define a 7-part rigid transform of (x,y,z,q0,q1,q2,q3), where q0,q1,q2,q3 is a normalised quaternion, and x, y, z are the translation.
Rotation is defined around the 0,0,0 point (Which is NOT THE CENTRE), and is performed before translation.

We create a scene with mulitple tetrahedra, each with a different transform. Return the transforms of such a scene
such that a shadow projected vertically (onto the Z=0 plane) fully covers PARAM, centered at the origin.

Use as many tetrahedra as you need, scoring is based on shadow coverage, not the number of tetrahedra used.

Score will be deducted for any shadow outside of the square, for reduntant tetrahedra, or non-normalised quaternions.

Creating 2D shapes with regular tetrahedrons isn't something that appears in much
training data, because, why on earth would you want to do that?
<br><br>
Perfect scores are possible for the square and holed square (two regular 
tetrahedrons seperated in z can make a shadow that casts to 90 degrees), and 
the circle has a weighting function that allows for the tiny difference between
chords and the circle itself.

Note that multiple rings of tetrahedra stacked in z and projected to z can
approximate a cricle very precisely, pixel perfect even.
